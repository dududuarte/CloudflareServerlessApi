## Serverless API
Hi, my name is Duarte and this is the API i came up with.

It has possibility of integration with upvotes (editing old post and add new value to upvote count), but for now only has the possibility of creation of posts and listing of said posts.

Since this is a 24 hour competition and i applied at the wrong time my solution doesn't have all extra credit since i had some trouble figuring out your Workers KV platform. But i must say it was fun to build the API to connect to it.
